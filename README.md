# Dropwizard Hibernate MultiTenant Bundle

This project is under development, therefore I will not recommend to use this code for production. However, if you find this interesting enough and want to contribute, please write to me at info.udit90@gmail.com.

I am developing it as part of my work requirements to support multitenancy in our exisiting dropwizard based web service application. Please expect an initial release on or before July 13, 2018.

To understand how to use this bundle with dropwizard, please have a look at demo application code hosted here: https://github.com/uditnarayan/dropwizard-hibernate-multitenant-example.

Cheers !!
